Perfect ðŸŽ‰ â€” this means your whole stack is working end-to-end now:

âœ… ALB (port 80) is reachable from the internet.

âœ… ALB forwards to ECS Target Group â†’ your container on FastAPI (port 8080).

âœ… FastAPI wrapper calls Ollama backend (port 11434) inside the same container.

âœ… Youâ€™re getting clean JSON responses (no more Extra data errors).

âœ… Tested multiple prompts (Hello World, capital of France, Leonardo da Vinci) â€” responses are consistent.

So your architecture flow is:

User (browser, curl, app)
        â”‚  HTTP:80
        â–¼
Application Load Balancer (ALB)
        â”‚  forwards
        â–¼
Target Group â†’ ECS Task (container)
        â”‚  FastAPI listens on 8080
        â–¼
FastAPI wrapper (ollama_api.py)
        â”‚  HTTP call
        â–¼
Ollama backend (port 11434, llama3 model)


Final AWS Ollama + FastAPI ECS Architecture
1. Networking (VPC + Subnets + Security)

VPC: One dedicated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Subnets: At least 2 public subnets in different AZs (us-east-1a, us-east-1b).

Internet Gateway: Provides internet access for public subnets.

Security Groups:

ALB security group â†’ allows inbound HTTP (port 80) from anywhere.

ECS task security group â†’ allows inbound only from ALB on port 8080.

2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)

ALB: Public-facing, listens on port 80.

Target Group: Routes requests to ECS tasks (container port 8080).

DNS: You got an ALB DNS name like:

http://ollama-alb-1938491981.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

3. ECS Cluster + Service

ECS Cluster: ollama-cluster (Fargate launch type).

ECS Service: ollama-service (1+ tasks, scalable).

Task Definition: Runs two containers inside one task:

Ollama container (ollama:latest) â†’ provides LLM inference on http://127.0.0.1:11434.

FastAPI container (ollama-api:latest) â†’ exposes REST endpoints (/, /healthz, /generate) to ALB on port 8080, and internally calls the Ollama container.

Communication: FastAPI talks to Ollama via localhost:11434 inside the task, so no external networking is needed between them.

4. Storage

EFS: Used for persisting Ollama model files (/root/.ollama/models).

Mount targets deployed in both subnets.

Attached to Ollama container as a volume.

Ensures models are downloaded once and reused across ECS task restarts.

5. IAM Roles

ECS Task Execution Role â†’ allows pulling images from ECR, writing logs to CloudWatch.

ECS Task Role â†’ (optional) could be extended if API needs access to S3 or other AWS services.

6. Monitoring & Logging

CloudWatch Logs:

/ecs/ollama log group.

Each container streams logs (uvicorn logs for FastAPI, ollama logs for model inference).

Helps debug issues like 404s or timeouts.

7. Flow of a Request

Client calls:

curl http://ollama-alb-1938491981.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/generate?prompt=Hello


ALB receives request â†’ forwards to ECS service â†’ FastAPI container.

FastAPI receives request on port 8080 â†’ sends POST to http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate.

Ollama container loads model from EFS â†’ generates response.

FastAPI returns JSON response â†’ ALB â†’ client.

âœ… Advantages of this Design

Scalable: Increase ECS task count behind ALB for more throughput.

Durable: EFS ensures model persistence across tasks.

Secure: Only ALB is public, tasks are in private subnets with restricted SGs.

Modular: Ollama and API are separate containers but run in the same task for localhost performance.

âš¡ In short:
You now have a production-grade Ollama inference API on AWS Fargate, fronted by an ALB, with EFS persistence for models, and CloudWatch monitoring.

Summary of Flow
User (port 80) 
   â†’ ALB (80) 
      â†’ Target Group (ECS Task IP:8080) 
         â†’ FastAPI in container (8080) 
            â†’ Ollama runtime (11434 local)
               â†’ Model response returned


So:

80 = Public entry (ALB listener)

8080 = FastAPI container port

11434 = Ollama runtime port inside container

{"model":"llama3:latest","output":"Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman, television personality, author, and politician who served as the 45th President of the United States from January 20, 2017 to January 20, 2021.\n\nTrump was a successful real estate developer and builder before entering politics. He became well-known through his appearances on the reality TV show \"The Apprentice\" (2004-2015), where he played the role of a tough-talking businessman who would say \"You're fired!\" to contestants who were eliminated from the competition.\n\nIn 2016, Trump launched an unconventional presidential campaign, using social media and making provocative statements to gain attention. Despite being considered an underdog by many pundits, he won the Republican primary and went on to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, winning the presidency with a surprise upset victory.\n\nAs President, Trump's policies and actions were highly controversial and polarizing. Some of his notable accomplishments include:\n\n1. Tax cuts: Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017), which lowered corporate tax rates and individual income tax rates for many Americans.\n2. Deregulation: He rolled back regulations in industries such as energy, finance, and healthcare, often citing job creation and economic growth.\n3. Supreme Court appointments: Trump nominated and confirmed two conservative justices to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch (2017) and Brett Kavanaugh (2018).\n4. Foreign policy: He was known for his confrontational style with other world leaders, particularly in NATO and with North Korea.\n\nHowever, Trump's presidency was also marked by:\n\n1. Controversial rhetoric: His use of language has been criticized for being divisive, racist, and sexist.\n2. Investigations: The Mueller investigation (2017-2019) found that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Trump win, while a separate investigation into his former lawyer Michael Cohen's activities led to Trump's first impeachment charges in December 2019.\n3. Controversial decisions: He withdrew the United States from several international agreements, including the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIn January 2021, Trump became the first U.S. President to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives. He was acquitted by the Senate in both cases."}http://ollama-alb-1022310736.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/generate?prompt=who+is+Leonardo+da+Vinci
