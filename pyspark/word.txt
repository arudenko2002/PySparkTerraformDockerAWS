Wow I just was at Walmart for a tire change last week and one of customers came back and angrily told the guy at the counter that his Camry had no oil Good thing he just drove from the Walmart auto center to the main parking lot when the dash lights went off Instead of just putting oil right where the auto center parking is the manager after confirming there was no oil and reassuring the pissed off older gentleman he then proceeded to drive it inside the bay still no oil
